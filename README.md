# Custom offline shipping methods
- Magento provides **several** out-of-the-box **offline shipping methods**, such as `Flatrate`, `Freeshipping`, `Pickup` and `Tablerate`.
- However, project requirements quite often are such that we need a **custom coded shipping method** where a **special business logic** is applied. Thus, the **shipping price calcualation** can be controlled by us.
- In such cases, knowing how to code our **own offline shipping method** might come in handy.
